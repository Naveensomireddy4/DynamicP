  "about": "Hi, I’m Somireddy Naveen Kumar Reddy — a Federated Learning researcher passionate about building AI systems that are not just smart, but also private, scalable, and adaptive. From computer vision to speech recognition, I’ve worked on solving real-world AI challenges like handling client dropout, tackling heterogeneous data, and making models efficient for edge devices. My mission is simple: push the boundaries of decentralized AI so it can empower industries and protect user privacy at the same time.",
